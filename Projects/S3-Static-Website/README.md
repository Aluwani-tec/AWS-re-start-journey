# S3 Static Website Hosting Project

## Project Overview
This project involved hosting a static website using Amazon S3. The goal was to understand how S3 can store and serve website content without a traditional web server.

## What I Did
- Created an S3 bucket for website hosting  
- Uploaded HTML and CSS files  
- Enabled static website hosting  
- Updated the bucket policy for public access  
- Tested the site using the S3 website endpoint  

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon S3  
- IAM (for bucket policy understanding)

## Outcome
The website was successfully hosted and accessible through the S3 public endpoint.

## Reflection
This project helped me understand how static sites run on S3 and how permissions affect access.
