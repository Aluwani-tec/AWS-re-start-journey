# Static Restaurant Website on AWS

This project demonstrates how a simple, cloud-hosted static website can
solve real operational challenges for a small restaurant.

The goal was to reduce booking and order confusion caused by manual
processes, while delivering a reliable, low-cost, and easy-to-maintain
digital solution.

## Business Problem

The restaurant managed bookings and orders through phone calls, emails,
and paper records. As customer demand increased, this approach led to:

- Order mix-ups and double bookings
- Delayed confirmations to customers
- No centralised view of customer requests
- Limited ability to scale without additional staff

The business needed a lightweight solution that improved efficiency
without introducing technical complexity.

## Solution

A static website was designed to act as a single digital touchpoint for
customers. The site allows users to:

- View restaurant information and menu items
- Submit booking requests online
- Place basic order requests
- Receive confirmation feedback

The solution prioritises clarity, usability, and reliability.

## Cloud Architecture

The website is hosted using AWS services with a focus on simplicity and
cost efficiency.

- **Amazon S3** hosts the static website and stores images
- **Static website hosting** provides high availability with no servers
- **Cloud-based delivery** ensures global accessibility
- **No backend infrastructure** reduces operational overhead

This architecture removes the need for on-premises systems and ongoing
server management.

## Benefits Delivered

- Reduced booking and order errors
- Centralised customer interaction channel
- Improved customer experience
- Minimal running costs
- Easy to maintain and scale

## Challenges and Trade-Offs

- Static websites cannot handle payments or complex logic on their own
- Form submissions require external handling or future backend services
- Design needed to balance simplicity with usability

These trade-offs were intentional to keep the solution lightweight and
appropriate for the business size.

## Key Learnings

- Simple solutions often deliver the highest business value
- Cloud services can replace manual processes without overengineering
- Static websites are powerful when paired with the right use case
- Cost awareness is as important as technical capability

## Conclusion

This project highlights how a static website hosted on AWS can
meaningfully improve operations for a small business.

It demonstrates practical cloud decision-making, a focus on user needs,
and the ability to design solutions that are effective, scalable, and
cost conscious.
