# Hi, I'm Olivia Aluwani Mahuluhulu  
### AWS re/Start Trainee | Cloud & IT Support Enthusiast  

Welcome to my AWS re/Start Journey repository.  
This repo documents my progress through the AWS re/Start programme – what I learned, the labs I completed, the projects I built, and how my technical skills have grown over time.

---

## Why I Joined AWS re/Start  

I joined AWS re/Start to build a solid, practical foundation in cloud computing and IT support.  
My goal is to move into a technical role where I can support users, troubleshoot systems, and work confidently with cloud infrastructure.

This repository is my **evidence of learning** – the work I would show to a recruiter, mentor, or hiring manager.

## AWS re/Start Journey Overview  

During the programme I completed hands-on labs, games (CloudQuest, SimuLearn), and guided projects that covered:

- How cloud computing differs from traditional on-premise IT  
- How to deploy and manage resources in AWS  
- How to troubleshoot issues using logs, metrics, and the CLI  
- How to think like a cloud/IT support professional when solving problems  

### Core Concepts Covered

- **Cloud Architecture & Design**  
- **AWS Compute & Storage:** EC2, S3  
- **Identity & Access Management:** IAM users, roles, policies  
- **Networking:** VPCs, subnets, IP addressing, security groups  
- **Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB fundamentals  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch basics  
- **Linux Administration:** CLI, users, permissions, processes  
- **Python Fundamentals** for basic scripting and automation

## Skills & Technologies Gained  

- **AWS Services:** EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, RDS, DynamoDB  
- **Linux:** Command line operations, permissions, updates, logs  
- **Networking:** OSI model, IP addressing, static/dynamic IPs, routing  
- **Scripting:** Python basics (variables, loops, simple scripts)  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, PuTTY, AWS CLI  

---

## Certifications & Learning Modules  

In the **Certification** folder, each `.md` file summarises a module or badge I’ve completed (SimuLearn, CloudQuest, GenAI and others).  
For each one, I document:

- What the module covered  
- Key concepts and takeaways  
- How it connects to real-world cloud or IT support work  
- Personal reflections  

---

## Labs  

The **Labs** folder contains detailed notes for the hands-on labs I completed during AWS re/Start.

Each lab write-up includes:

- **Objective** – what the lab was designed to teach  
- **Overview** – short description in my own words  
- **Steps Taken** – what I did and why  
- **Screenshots** – 2–3 key images showing the setup or results  
- **Result** – what I achieved at the end  
- **Challenges & Lessons** – what went wrong and what I learned  

Lab domains include:

- Compute  
- Storage  
- Networking  
- Databases  
- Linux  
- Security  
- Python  
- Management & Monitoring

## Projects  

### 1. Static Website on Amazon S3  
Hosted a static website using **Amazon S3** with static website hosting, bucket policies, and public access configuration.  
This project demonstrates my understanding of S3, permissions, and basic web hosting in a serverless way.

---

### 2. 3D AWS Architecture Project  
Worked on a **3-tier AWS architecture** design including VPCs, public and private subnets, routing tables, EC2 instances, IAM, and a managed database service.  
The focus was on scalability, separation of layers, and basic security best practices.

### 3. AWS Lex Chatbot Project – Quiz Bot for Students  
Final Praesignis project: designed and built an interactive **Amazon Lex chatbot**.

**Key elements:**
- Built a simple intent-based chatbot to answer basic AWS questions  
- Created a quiz-style bot for a fictional client (CloudLearners Inc.)  
- Used **intents, utterances and branching logic** to handle correct/incorrect answers  
- Implemented a short S3 quiz (“What does S3 stand for?”, “What is S3 mainly used for?”)  
- Tested full flows: start quiz → questions → feedback → next question  

This project combined cloud services with AI-driven interaction and included a formal presentation and live demo in the AWS console.

## Impact of the Journey  

AWS re/Start has:

- Given me confidence to work hands-on in the AWS Console  
- Strengthened my troubleshooting and problem-solving mindset  
- Built a strong foundation in networking, Linux and cloud services  
- Prepared me for an entry-level cloud or IT support role  

This repository is a record of that growth.
