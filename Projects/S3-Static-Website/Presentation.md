# Static Restaurant Website on AWS

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a static website
for a small restaurant, built to improve how customer bookings and
orders are handled.

The solution focuses on simplicity, reliability, and cost efficiency,
showing how cloud services can replace manual and error-prone processes
with a lightweight digital presence.

## Problem Context

The restaurant relied on manual methods such as phone calls, emails,
and paper records to manage bookings and orders. As customer demand
increased, this led to:

- Order mix-ups and double bookings
- Delays in confirming customer requests
- No central place to track customer interactions
- Difficulty scaling without hiring more staff

A simple static website was identified as an effective way to reduce
operational friction without adding technical complexity.

## Solution Overview

A static website was designed to allow customers to:

- View restaurant information and menu items
- Submit booking requests online
- Place basic order requests
- Receive confirmation feedback

The website is hosted on AWS using cloud-native services to ensure
availability, performance, and low operating cost.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Amazon S3** used to host the static website and store images
- **Static website hosting** enabled for high reliability
- **Globally accessible content** with minimal infrastructure
- **No backend servers required**, reducing complexity and cost

This approach eliminates the need for on-premises systems while
providing a professional online presence.

## Key Benefits

- Reduced booking and order errors
- Centralised customer interaction channel
- Improved customer experience
- Low-cost, scalable solution
- No server maintenance or infrastructure overhead

## Challenges and Trade-Offs

- Static websites cannot process payments or complex logic without
  additional services
- Forms require external handling or future backend integration
- Design needed to remain simple while still being user friendly

These trade-offs were accepted to keep the solution lightweight and
easy to maintain.

## Key Takeaways

- Not every business problem requires a complex system
- Static websites are effective for many real-world use cases
- Cloud services enable small businesses to scale without large upfront
  investment
- Simplicity often delivers the highest value

## Summary

This project demonstrates how a static website hosted on AWS can solve
real operational challenges for a small business.

It highlights practical cloud decision-making, cost awareness, and a
focus on user experience rather than unnecessary technical complexity.
