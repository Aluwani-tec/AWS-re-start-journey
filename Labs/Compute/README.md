# Compute Module 

This folder documents a SimuLearn Compute lab completed as part of the AWS re/Start Programme.  
The lab focuses on **upgrading an Amazon EC2 instance** to provide greater computing power and memory capacity for a school’s class scheduling system.

---

## Scenario: Computing Solutions

A school operates a class scheduling system hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.  
Due to increasing demand, the system requires **more compute and memory resources** to remain responsive and reliable.

**Task Requirement:**  
Upgrade the EC2 instance to a **larger instance type** and verify that the system continues to run correctly after the change.

---

## What This Lab Covers

- Reviewing an existing EC2 instance configuration
- Accessing instance metadata from inside the server
- Inspecting application logs
- Comparing EC2 instance families and sizes
- Performing a controlled instance type upgrade
- Verifying application stability after the upgrade

---


---

## Outcome

- The EC2 instance was successfully upgraded from a smaller instance type to a larger one.
- Application logs and metadata confirmed the new configuration.
- The scheduling system continued operating normally after the upgrade.
- The task demonstrated how to safely scale compute and memory resources on AWS.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- EC2 instance management
- Right-sizing compute resources
- Reading and interpreting application logs
- Understanding instance families and use cases
- Applying AWS operational best practices
